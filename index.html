        <h2>Maze Game</h2>
        <p><a href="http://http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/862206610">Link to Game</a></p>
        <p>This is a game I coded on Scratch where the player spawns in a random place and has to navigate through the randomly generated maze to the gold area within a certain period of time. The player can modify how quick their character moves or how much time they have.</p>

        <p><a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/898516391">Link to App</a></p>
        <p>The drawing app project is quite simple. The user is asked how many sides the shape should have, and the character on screen will draw their answer as a shape. So, if the user responds with “8 sides,” then, the character on screen will draw an octagon. And so on. It works with any number of sides. If the user responds with “1” or “2” sides, then, there will be an error, and the code will ask for a different number.

        <h2>Instagram Macro</h2>
        
        <p>This software is actually intended to provide value to small businesses and make money. First, it needs a list of usernames for it to engage with for it to work. How it works: it will go to each username, follow them, and like their pictures. After 2 days, it will automatically unfollow the people they followed. It is all automatic and can run every day. This is very helpful for small businesses because all they need is a list of usernames that are their niche customers and could be potential leads. Then, the software works and potentially increases their sales.

        <h2>AP Create</h2>

        <p>This is my AP Create Project which is the classic snake game. Going over an apple with the snake that you control adds a point to the score, and then another apple randomly generates.

        <p>This project is a traffic light system made using a Pico Pi. It cycles through green, to yellow, to red, and back to green. This simulation helped me understand hardware utilizing LEDs.</p>
