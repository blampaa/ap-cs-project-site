      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="img/philosopher.jpg" alt="pierce">
      <p>I put a philosopher who is lost in thought to represent me for a few reasons. First, I live by philosophy. I live by the 4 virtues of the stoics and many other philosophies of wisdom, temperance (self-restraint), courage, and justice. With every decision, I have these in mind. I donâ€™t think and contemplate nearly as much as philosophers do, however, I still put aside time every day to self-reflect and to improve as a human being.
